# ☕ BrewCrew Club

**BrewCrew Club** is a community-driven platform designed exclusively for coffee lovers.
Whether you’re a **casual café hopper**, a **serious home brewer**, or a **barista showing off latte art**, BrewCrew Club is your digital home for everything coffee.

Our mission?
👉 To create India’s first community + rewards ecosystem for beverage culture — starting with coffee, but embracing tea, cafés, and other beverage-first hangout spots.

Our mission is to connect people with the best places to sip, chill, and connect, while building a social + perks-driven community that rewards exploration and passion for great drinks.

Because at the end of the day, it’s not just about coffee or tea — it’s about the culture, conversations, and community that grow around every cup. ☕🍵✨

Because coffee isn’t just a drink… it’s a lifestyle. 🚀
